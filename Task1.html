            In today’s fast-evolving academic and professional environments, cultivating essential skills is crucial for achieving success.
            Core competencies such as <b>communication</b>, <b>critical thinking</b>, <b>teamwork</b>, <b>time management</b>, and <b>digital literacy</b>
            empower individuals to navigate educational and workplace demands with confidence and flexibility.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Communication skills</b>, both verbal and written, are necessary for expressing ideas clearly in reports, presentations, and meetings
              <a href="#ref1" class="ref-link">[1]</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Critical thinking</b> allows students and professionals to analyse information, solve problems, and make informed decisions
              <a href="#ref2" class="ref-link">[2]</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Teamwork and collaboration</b> are fundamental in almost every workplace, where projects often require input from diverse teams
              <a href="#ref3" class="ref-link">[3]</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Time management</b> helps balance deadlines and workloads, improving productivity and reducing stress
              <a href="#ref4" class="ref-link">[4]</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              With technology constantly evolving, <b>digital literacy</b>—the ability to use digital tools and platforms efficiently—is also indispensable
              <a href="#ref1" class="ref-link">[1]</a>.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In my chosen career as a software engineer, these skills will be critical. For instance, communication and teamwork will support collaboration with designers, developers, and clients. Time management will help me meet tight development deadlines, while critical thinking is essential in troubleshooting code and optimizing systems. Digital literacy, particularly knowledge of coding platforms and project management tools like GitHub or Jira, will be an everyday requirement.
          </p>
          <p>
            By strengthening these skills during my academic journey, I will be better prepared to thrive in the dynamic field of software engineering.

          My Turnitin similarity score was <b>10%</b>. I consider this a good result, as it indicates that most of the work is my own opinion. This low percentage is likely due to the correct use of citations and active paraphrasing of sources in IEEE style. To improve this in the future (or to maintain this level), I will continue to carefully paraphrase ideas rather than copy-pasting, and I will always check that each source is properly cited. I will also ensure that any overlaps are only technical elements, such as titles or common phrases.
